### Requirements

1. Build the frontend of the application using React ✅
2. Utilize the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/) to fetch the list of countries and their details. ✅
3. Display a list of countries on the page, showing their name, flag, and basic information like population,
   language(s), and currency/currencies. ✅
4. Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for countries by name, language, or currency
   without triggering a page reload. ✅
5. Use Ag-Grid to display the list. ✅
6. Display the search results in a list format, showing relevant information for each country, all within the same page. ✅
7. Allow users to view the full details of a country when clicking on row, without navigating to a separate page. ✅
8. Implement a favorites feature that allows users to mark countries as favorites and view their list of favorite countries. ✅
9. Use local storage to persist the user's favorite countries between page reloads. ✅
10. Add appropriate error handling for cases like API failures or invalid requests. ✅

### Bonus

1. Implement pagination for the list of countries, showing a limited number of countries per page, but ensure it remains a single-page application. ✅
2. Include sorting options for the list of countries, e.g., sort by name, population, or currency. ✅
3. Add a feature to filter countries based on various criteria, e.g., filter by language or currency. ✅
4. Style Ag-Grid for visual appeal and usability ✅
